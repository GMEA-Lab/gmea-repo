##Notes about estimated snow and ice layers
##This code is still a work in progress....below are some thoughts

##I decided how to label snow vs ice vs air vs water based on previous research (see lit. folder).
##However I think this research was done mostly in the cold and so the rules they suggest may break 
##down when it's warmer (ie may). May need to reassess the snow/ice interfaces when it gets warmer but I'm not sure how to.

##The temps are available every 6h, however there are some time periods missing. I have interpolated those missing data.

##The sensor readings are only available 1x per day, so they were applied to each time period. 
##So may just want to look into using only the time period for which they are available (which I think is 18:00)

##Right now the estimates are for every 6h, may want to look into using just daily values since that would give less variation

##The snow/air interface couldn't be estimated for every time period (especially in the end) so I interpolated between estimates. Again not sure if this was best practice...?
##But it seemed like the finer the resolution to correlate with fish/zoop density the better?

##snow/ice measurements can be compared to nearby measurements:

##I am worried about the snow depths, the ice I think is pretty good (except for the end of May)
